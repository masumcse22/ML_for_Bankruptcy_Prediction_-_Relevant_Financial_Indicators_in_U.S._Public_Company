## üöÄ Project Overview  
This project focuses on leveraging **machine learning** to predict the likelihood of bankruptcy in U.S. public companies using key financial indicators. By utilizing historical financial data and advanced classification algorithms, this project aims to provide actionable insights for **financial analysts**, **investors**, and **business decision-makers**.  

Bankruptcy prediction is crucial for mitigating risks, optimizing investments, and ensuring financial stability. This tool seeks to serve as an early warning system, helping stakeholders make informed decisions.

## üìä Key Objectives  
- Develop a reliable **machine learning pipeline** to predict bankruptcy.  
- Analyze and select **relevant financial indicators** that significantly influence bankruptcy.  
- Evaluate and compare multiple classification algorithms for accuracy and efficiency.  

---

## üîç Dataset  
The dataset comprises historical financial data of U.S. public companies, including indicators such as:  
- **Debt-to-Equity Ratio**  
- **Return on Assets (ROA)**  
- **Net Profit Margin**  
- **Operating Cash Flow Ratio**  
- **Earnings Per Share (EPS)**  
- **Working Capital Ratio**  

The dataset also includes the target variable indicating bankruptcy status (`Bankruptcy: Yes/No`).

## üìà Results  
The project achieved significant accuracy with the **[best-performing algorithm]**, demonstrating its capability to predict bankruptcy effectively. Key insights include:  
- **[Highlight key findings, e.g., "Debt-to-Equity Ratio was the most influential predictor."]**  
- **[Mention any unexpected trends, e.g., "Higher EPS values did not significantly reduce bankruptcy risk."]**
